'''

Design a stack-like data structure. You should be able to push elements to 
this data structure and pop elements with maximum frequency. 

You'll need to implement the FreqStack class that should consist 
of the following: 

- Init(): This is a constructor used to declare a frequency stack. 
- Push(value): This is used to push an integer data onto the top 
  of the stack. 
- Pop(): This is used to remove and return the most frequent element in 
  the stack.


  Note: If there is a tie for the most frequent element, then the 
  most recently pushed element is removed and returned.
