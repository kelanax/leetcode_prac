PROBLEM: 

Given a singly linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes of the linked list. 
After the swap, return the head of the linked list.

Note: Solve the problem without modifying the values in the listâ€™s nodes. 
In other words, only the nodes themselves can be changed.

--------------------------------------------
PATTERN: IN PLACE REVERSAL OF A LINKED LIST
