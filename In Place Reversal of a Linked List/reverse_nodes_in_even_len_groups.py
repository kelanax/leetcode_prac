PROBLEM: 

Youâ€™re given a linked list. Your task is to reverse all of the nodes that are present 
in the groups with an even number of nodes in them. The nodes in the linked list are 
sequentially assigned to non-empty groups whose lengths form the sequence of the natural 
numbers ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4... ) (1,2,3,4...) . The length of a group is the number of nodes 
assigned to it. In other words: 

- The 1 st node is assigned to the first group. 
- The 2 nd and 3 rd nodes are assigned to the second group. 
- The 4 th ,  5 th , and  6 th nodes are assigned to the third group and so on. 
You have to return the head of the modified linked list.

Note: The length of the last group may be less than or equal to 1 + the length of the 
second to the last group
