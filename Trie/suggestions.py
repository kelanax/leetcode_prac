PROBLEM: 

Given an array of strings called products and a word to search, design 
a system that, when each character of the searched word is typed, suggests 
at most three product names from products. Suggested products should share a 
common prefix with the searched word. If more than three products exist with a 
common prefix, return the three product names that appear first in lexicographical 
order. 

Return the suggested products, which will be a list of lists after each 
character of searched word is typed.
